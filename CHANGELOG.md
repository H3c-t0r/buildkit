## Unreleased

## 3.0-beta.29 - 2017-07-18
### Added
- Added a `--timestamp-lines` option to `buildkite-agent start` that will insert RFC3339 UTC timestamps at the beginning of each log line. The timestamps are not applied to header lines. [#501] (@lox)
- Ctrl-c twice will force kill the agent [#499] (@lox)
- Set the content encoding on artifacts uploaded to s3 [#494] (thanks @airhorns)
- Output fetched commit sha during git fetch for pull request [#505] (@sj26)

### Changed
- Migrate the aging goamz library to the latest aws-sdk [#474] (@lox)

## 2.6.5 - 2017-07-18
### Added
- üîç Output fetched commit sha during git fetch for pull request [#505]

## 3.0-beta.28 - 2017-06-23
### Added
- üêû The agent will now poll the AWS EC2 Tags API until it finds some tags to apply before continuing. In some cases, the agent will start and connect to Buildkite before the tags are available. The timeout for this polling can be configured with --wait-for-ec2-tags-timeout (which defaults to 10 seconds) #492

### Fixed
- üêõ Fixed 2 Windows bugs that caused all jobs that ran through our built-in buildkite-agent bootstrap command to fail #496

## 2.6.4 - 2017-06-16
### Added
- üöÄ The buildkite-agent upstart configuration will now source /etc/default/buildkite-agent before starting the agent process. This gives you an opportunity to configure the agent outside of the standard buildkite-agent.conf file

## 3.0-beta.27 - 2017-05-31
### Added
- Allow pipeline uploads when no-command-eval is true

### Fixed
- üêû Fixes to a few more edge cases when exported environment variables from hooks would include additional quotes #484
- Apt server misconfigured - `Packages` reports wrong sizes/hashes
- Rewrote `export -p` parser to support multiple line env vars

## 3.0-beta.26 - 2017-05-29
### Fixed
- ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è We accidentally skipped a beta version, there's no v3.0-beta.25! Doh!
- üêõ Fixed an issue where some environment variables exported from environment hooks would have new lines appended to the end

## 3.0-beta.24 - 2017-05-26
### Added
- üöÄ Added an --append option to buildkite-agent annotate that allows you to append to the body of an existing annotation

### Fixed
- üêõ Fixed an issue where exporting multi-line environment variables from a hook would truncate everything but the first line

## 3.0-beta.23 - 2017-05-10
### Added
- üöÄ New command buildkite-agent annotate that gives you the power to annotate a build page with information from your pipelines. This feature is currently experimental and the CLI command API may change before an official 3.0 release

## 2.6.3 - 2017-05-04
### Added
- Added support for local and global pre-exit hooks (#466)

## 3.0-beta.22 - 2017-05-04
### Added
- Renames --meta-data to --tags (#435). --meta-data will be removed in v4, and v3 versions will now show a deprecation warning.
- Fixes multiple signals not being passed to job processes (#454)
- Adds binaries for OpenBSD (#463) and DragonflyBSD (#462)
- Adds support for local and global pre-exit hooks (#465)

## 2.6.2 - 2017-05-02
### Fixed
- Backport #381 to stable: Retries for fetching EC2 metadata and tags. #461

### Added
- Add OpenBSD builds

## 2.6.1 - 2017-04-13
### Removed
- Reverted #451 as it introduced a regression. Will re-think this fix and push it out again in another release after we do some more testing

## 3.0-beta.21 - 2017-04-13
### Removed
- Reverts the changes made in #448 as it seemed to introduce a regression. We'll rethink this change and push it out in another release.

## 2.6.0 - 2017-04-13
### Fixed
- Use /bin/sh rather than /bin/bash when executing commands. This allows use in environments that don't have bash, such as Alpine Linux.

## 3.0-beta.20 - 2017-04-13
### Added
- Add plugin support for HTTP repositories with .git extensions [#447]
- Run the global environment hook before checking out plugins [#445]

### Changed
- Use /bin/sh rather than /bin/bash when executing commands. This allows use in environments that don't have bash, such as Alpine Linux. (#448)

## 3.0-beta.19 - 2017-03-29
### Added
- `buildkite-agent start --disconnect-after-job` will run the agent, and automatically disconnect after running it's first job. This has sometimes been referred to as "one shot" mode and is useful when you spin up an environment per-job and want the agent to automatically disconnect once it's finished it's job
- `buildkite-agent start --disconnect-after-job-timeout` is the time in seconds the agent will wait for that first job to be assigned. The default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes). If a job isn't assigned to the agent after this time, it will automatically disconnect and the agent process will stop.

## 3.0-beta.18 - 2017-03-27

## [2.3] - 2016-11-10
### Fixed

- Support for the steps.json file has been removed

## 3.0-beta.12 - 2016-10-14

### Added
- AWS EC2 meta-data tagging is now more resilient and will retry on failure (#381)
- Substring expansion works for variables in pipeline uploads, like ${BUILDKITE_COMMIT:0:7} will return the first seven characters of the commit SHA (#387)

## 3.0-beta.10 - 2016-09-21
### Added
- The buildkite-agent binary is now built with Golang 1.7 giving us support for macOS Sierra
- The agent now talks HTTP2 making calls to the Agent API that little bit faster
- The binary is a statically compiled (no longer requiring libc)
- meta-data-ec2 and meta-data-ec2-tags can now be configured using BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2 and BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2_TAGS environment variables


## [2.2] - 2016-09-21
### Added
- The buildkite-agent binary is now built with Golang 1.7 giving us support for macOS Sierra
- The agent now talks HTTP2 making calls to the Agent API that little bit faster
- The binary is a statically compiled (no longer requiring libc)
- meta-data-ec2 and meta-data-ec2-tags can now be configured using BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2 and BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2_TAGS environment variables

### Changed
- We've removed our dependency of libc for greater compatibly across \*nix systems which has had a few side effects:
  We've had to remove support for changing the process title when an agent starts running a job. This feature has only ever been available to users running 64-bit ubuntu, and required us to have a dependency on libc. We'd like to bring this feature back in the future in a way that doesn't have us relying on libc
- The agent will now use Golangs internal DNS resolver instead of the one on your system. This probably won't effect you in any real way, unless you've setup some funky DNS settings for agent.buildkite.com
